# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Exploration

In this folder, I'm embarking on a journey to understand and implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices in my Python projects. TDD is a methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code, leading to more reliable and maintainable software.

## What's Inside

- **Test Cases**: Discover a set of test files where I'll be developing test cases for various aspects of my Python code.
- **Code Implementation**: Witness the development of code that fulfills the requirements outlined by the test cases.
- **TDD Process**: Follow along with my thought process as I walk through the steps of writing tests, implementing code, and ensuring compatibility.
- **Benefits of TDD**: Learn about the advantages of TDD, including improved code quality, better documentation, and enhanced collaboration.

## Why TDD?

By focusing on writing tests before writing the code itself, I'm aiming to create more robust and maintainable software. TDD encourages clear specification of requirements and helps catch potential issues early in the development process.

Feel free to explore the content in this folder as I dive into the world of Test-Driven Development using Python. If you have any insights, questions, or suggestions, I'd love to hear from you.

Happy coding and testing!
